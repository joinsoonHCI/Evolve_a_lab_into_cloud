- The big 3，the technology part： among cloud, AI, and data science, cloud is providing the supporting structure; it is leading the business. 

    * AI is also related to another low profile but important thing, text and git. The path of the relationship is:  
        - AI -> natural language processing -> speech to text -> the importance of text -> markdown and ymal -> git. 
    
	* DevOps: cloud is making Dev and Ops into one thing, by integrating 4 things: network-security, server-database-admin, architect, and development. 
		- One small but significant thing to make Ops closer to Dev: Windows scripting (powershell) is now similar to Linux's.  
		- Recent years, agile CI/CD is making Dev closer to Ops.    
        - Recent years, micro-services is also making Dev closer to Ops.
		- Parallel processing brings Dev and Ops together. And, it goes deeper: it brings functional programming. 
		
    * Summary of the above: the "String theory architecture" in cloud 
	    - Natural Language Processing, text/git 
		- Microservice, functional language
        - NoSQL database, log-centric/stream processing/event sourcing		
		
- MS C# vs Java-and-others 
    * The differences between MS and Sun (Oracle) and Google, the traditional MS vs open source, are less obvious now, because MS open sourced many things. 
    * So, we should treat .Net, C#, F# the same as Java, Python, Node.js, and other languages. 
    * As a matter of fact, on cloud, the focus is not "standardize on this or that"; instead, it is to synthesize， orchestra， or choreography multiple parts regardless their languages. 

- The big 3, the company part: among AWS, GCP, Azure, AWS is good at cloud per se, the "Ops" part; Azure is good at the "Dev" part, especially with the MS side; GCP is also good at the "Dev" part, but especially the open source side.

- Off-the-shelve: all those elements, cloud, AI, data science, and DevOps, are about the whole system. As a result, we cannot obtain them by buying; instead, we have to grow them -- evolve the system and the DevOps team, and, the user community (the "business"). 
    * In other words, move the current system to the cloud, piece by piece.  
    * This repo is the architecture, the agile process, and, mostly importantly, the continuously learning, of the journey.
