- The big 3， technologies： among cloud, AI, and data science, cloud is providing the supporting structure; it is leading the business. 

- The big 3, companies: among AWS, GCP, Azure, AWS is good at cloud per se, the "Ops" part; Azure is good at the "Dev" part, especially with the MS side; GCP is also good at the "Dev" part, but especially the open source side.

- MS C# vs Java and others: the differences between MS and Google, the traditional MS vs open source, is less obvious now, because MS open sourced many things. 
    * We should treat .Net, C#, F# the same as Java, python, node.js, and other languages. 
    * As a matter of fact, on cloud, the focus is not "standardize on this or that", instead, it is to synthesize， orchestra， or choreography multiple parts regardless their languages. 
    * Further, on cloud, three things are happening simultaneously: 
	     * Windows scripting (power shell) is now similar to Linux's;  
        * Cloud is making network/server-admin/DBA tasks much simpler, and making them close or even identical to application Dev.   
        * As a result, Dev and Ops are really integrated -- both are already becoming together because of agile CI/CD.    

- Off-the-shelve: all those 3 elements, cloud, AI, data science, are all whole-system-related. As a result, we cannot obtain them by buying; instead, we have to grow them -- evolve the system and the DevOps team, and, the user community (the "business"). 
    * In other words, move the current system to the cloud, piece by piece.  
    * This repo is the architecture, the agile process, and, mostly importantly, the continuously learning, of the journey.
